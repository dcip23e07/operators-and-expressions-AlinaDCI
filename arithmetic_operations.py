var_a = 1500 + 3000
var_b = 1500 + 3000.00
var_c = 1000/5
# var_d = 1200 + "200"
var_e = "3004" + "996"

# 1.Printing the results of two varables a, b
print("the result of var_a: ", var_a) # 2. Difference: data type = int
print("the result of var_b: ", var_b) # 2. Difference: data type = float

# 3. What type of object is var_c?
# Answer: Arithmetic expression

# 4. What is the value of var_d? what happened when you tried to run that expression?
# Answer: The value would asummably be the result of adding two values in the expression.
# Attempted addition of str to int fails, beacuse this operation is not possible.

# 5. What is the value of var_e? and what object is it?
# Answer: the value will be the concatenated value of the two strings
# Object: the resulting string "3004996"
